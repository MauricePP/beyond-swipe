Design & Experience
The app features a clean, photo-centric interface inspired by Instagram's visual browsing experience, but oriented toward creating meaningful connections. The aesthetic is modern and sophisticated, appealing to users serious about finding relationships rather than casual browsing.
Tone & Language
Beyond Swipes uses direct, action-oriented language that emphasizes real-world connections. The app's communication avoids flowery dating clichés, instead using clear, straightforward prompts like:
"Suggest a meeting place" rather than "Where would you like to meet?"
"Accept date" rather than "Are you interested in this date?"
"Propose alternative" rather than "Would you prefer something else?"
This straightforward tone reinforces the app's purpose: moving beyond digital interaction to real-world connection.
Implementation Priorities
Core Matching System: The three-like system and date proposal workflow are the foundational differentiators
Safety Infrastructure: Implement comprehensive safety features from day one to build trust
Visual Experience: Create a polished, photo-forward interface that encourages quality visual storytelling
Verification Systems: Establish date verification and feedback systems to ensure platform integrity
Premium Features: Develop value-added features that enhance the experience without creating a two-tier system
The Beyond Swipes platform represents a paradigm shift in online dating by focusing on the end goal—meaningful in-person connections—rather than endless digital interaction. By implementing structured pathways to meeting and robust safety systems, the app provides a refreshing alternative in a market saturated with chat-first applications.
